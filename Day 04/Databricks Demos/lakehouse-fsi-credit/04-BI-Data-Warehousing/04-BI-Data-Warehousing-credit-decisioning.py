# MAGIC # Your Lakehouse is the best Warehouse
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Traditional Data Warehouses can’t keep up with the variety of data and use cases. Business agility requires reliable, real-time data, with insight from ML models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Working with the lakehouse unlock traditional BI analysis but also real time applications having a direct connection to your entire data, while remaining fully secured.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC This includes the next-generation vectorized query engine Photon, which together with SQL warehouses, provides up to 12x better price/performance than other cloud data warehouses.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Serverless warehouse** provide instant, elastic SQL compute — decoupled from storage — and will automatically scale to provide unlimited concurrency without disruption, for high concurrency use cases.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make no compromise. Your best Datawarehouse is a Lakehouse.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our users can now start running SQL queries using the SQL editor and add new visualizations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By leveraging auto-completion and the schema browser, we can start running adhoc queries on top of our data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While this is ideal for Data Analyst to start analysing our customer Churn, other personas can also leverage DBSQL to track our data ingestion pipeline, the data quality, model behavior etc.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [Queries menu](/sql/queries) to start writting your first analysis.

# MAGIC # Driving our Credit score business with Databricks DBSQL
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we have ingested all these various sources of data and enriched them with our ML model, we can visualize all the results integrate all the information in a single dashboard using Databricks SQL.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC  Here are the types of insights we are able to derive and display: 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Opportunities ($) to upsell credit products to customers
# MAGIC * Risk based on alternative data sources like telco payments
# MAGIC * Loss Given Default - Risk is only a piece of the puzzle for credit decisioning. The bank or FSI needs to understand what losses are estimated given risk profiles.
# MAGIC * Explainability of credit decisions using all features and model explainability library SHAP

# MAGIC <a href="/sql/dashboards/21cc72b0-323d-454f-a799-76336525ce61" target="_blank">Open the DBSQL dashboard</a> to explore this information. <br/><br/>
